# Real-Time Signal Processing Application

This project is a real-time signal processing application for monitoring and analyzing physiological signals. The application provides real-time feedback and alerts based on signal anomalies.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



### Usage

Run the signal acquisition script:
```bash
python signal_acquisition.py
```

Process the signals:
```bash
python signal_processing.py
```

Analyze the signals in real-time:
```bash
python real_time_analysis.py
```

Get real-time feedback and alerts:
```bash
python feedback_alerts.py
```
